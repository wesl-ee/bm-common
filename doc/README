bmffd was developed as an https solution to allow remote, secure access to
files. bmffd was implemented originally at https://bigmike.sne.jp/onsen/.

bmffd currently ships with these features:

- remote directory navigation
	any files put into share/ are addressable by the end-user of bmffd.
	access to any files outside of share/ is strictly prohibited through
	the interface
- directory zipping
	some directories can be zipped. currently, this is folders which
	contain music files or only images. this is born of the needs of
	bigmike.sne.jp and the definition of a "zippable folder" will likely
	change
- image gallery
	if a directory contains only images, that folder may be viewed as a
	gallery using the super_simple_image_viewer_v3.js. this js is
	planned to be deprecated in favor of js I will write myself becuase
	I am reading a javascript book I bought at a booksale at university.

these features are planned for bmffd:

- file tagging
	I am very excited to implement a file tagger that I helping to
	debug and develop. In future builds, bmffd will ship with a
	search function which lets you search for any file tagged with your
	query. only local users will be trusted to add/remove tags.
- optional user verification
	as is the case on bigmike.sne.jp/onsen, I have a SQL table of
	users who are allowed to access bmffd. integrating this into the git
	repo is a non-issue, I just need the motivation to do it.
- configuration
	planned implementation of a /includes/config.php will aid
	administrators in deployment of bmffd
