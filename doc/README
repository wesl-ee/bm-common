bmffd was developed as an https solution to allow remote, secure access to
files. bmffd was implemented originally at https://bigmike.sne.jp/onsen/.

bmffd currently ships with these features:

- remote directory navigation
	any files put into share/ are addressable by the end-user of bmffd.
	access to any files outside of share/ is strictly prohibited through
	the interface
- directory zipping
	some directories can be zipped. currently, this is folders which
	contain music files or only images. this is born of the needs of
	bigmike.sne.jp and the definition of a "zippable folder" will likely
	change
- file gallery
	Clicking on any file in the filemanager opens it in the gallery.
	The gallery can currently display audio and video files, but being
	able to display txt files is planned for the development.
- optional user authentication
	Including includes/auth.php at the top of a file forces the user to
	log in to access the page. The authentication references a SQL table
	which is defined in includes/config.php
- per-deployment configuration
	per-deployment settings are defined in includes/config.php
- file tagging
	bmfft now fills the file tagger niche, plans to obsolete file
