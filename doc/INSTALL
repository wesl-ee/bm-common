bmffd requires some things to be installed:

* lighttpd, apache or another http server capable of executing php
* php
* the "zip" utility


ARCH LINUX INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS
1. Install lighttpd and php if you do not have another http server already

$ pacman -S lighttpd php php-cgi

2. Set up lighttpd to understand php

$ cat /etc/lighttpd/conf.d/fastcgi.conf

  server.modules += ("mod_fastcgi")

  index-file.names += ("index.php")
  fastcgi.server = ( 
      # Load-balance requests for this path...
      ".php" => (
          # ... among the following FastCGI servers. The string naming each
          # server is just a label used in the logs to identify the server.
          "localhost" => ( 
              "allow-x-send-file" => "enable" ,
              "bin-path" => "/usr/bin/php-cgi",
              "socket" => "/tmp/php-fastcgi.sock",
              # breaks SCRIPT_FILENAME in a way that PHP can extract PATH_INFO
              # from it 
              "broken-scriptfilename" => "enable",
              # Launch (max-procs + (max-procs * PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN)) procs, where
              # max-procs are "watchers" and the rest are "workers". See:
              # https://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/1/wiki/frequentlyaskedquestions#How-many-php-CGI-processes-will-lighttpd-spawn 
              "max-procs" => 4, # default value
              "bin-environment" => (
                  "PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN" => "1" # default value
              )
          )
      )   
  )

$ cat /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf

  server.document-root = "/var/http/"

  server.port = 80
  server.username = "http"
  server.groupname = "http"
  server.pid-file = "/var/run/lighttpd.pid"

  mimetype.assign = (
    ".html" => "text/html", 
    ".txt" => "text/plain",
    ".jpg" => "image/jpeg",
    ".png" => "image/png",
    ".js" => "text/javascript",
    ".css" => "text/css"
  )
  index-file.names = ( "index.html", "index.php" )
  include "conf.d/fastcgi.conf"

3. Install bmffd to a directory which lighttpd can read

$ cd /var/http/
$ git clone https://bigmike.sne.jp/git/bmffd.git

4. Put files inside share/
- or mount a drive to share/
- or mount a network drive to share/
- or symlink share/ to /dev/random

- the possibilities are endless!

5. Start lighttpd
$ service start lighttpd
or 
$ systemctl start lighttpd

6. Point your browser to http://localhost/filemanager.php
