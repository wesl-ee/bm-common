	<h2>rule of thumb</h2>
	<p>Tag what you see. In other words, only tag the visual and factual elements in the image. For example, images where the full moon is prominently depicted will have a full_moon tag. Ideally you should use an existing tag.
	<p>This means you should not tag what you know about a character. For example remilia_scarlet is supposed to be a vampire, but don't tag every picture depicting her with the vampire tag. Only use the vampire tag if the characteristics are clearly visible.</p>
	<p>Do not use subjective tags (such as sexy, cute, hot, etc). These tags are problematic because they are based on personal opinion, and different opinions can conflict.</p>
